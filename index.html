About me:  
* 6+ years experience in applied research, developing algorithms to make insightful use of data and supporting software, primarily related to individual and societal health.  
* Breadth of experience - spanning machine learning model development (deep learning time series prediction, object detection and image classification, embedded model deployment), research-level data pipeline development, data analysis and statistics, and web development - aimed at developing a "full stack data science" skillset.  
* Especially passionate about health technology; understanding human minds, health, and behavior at multiple scales; and ventures for good.
